This step allows the user to identify potential outliers among the samples and define a threshold for their removal. Users can re-run the clustering to assess whether the selected height is appropriate. Samples that fall below the specified height (indicated by the red bar) will be retained. If the height is set to 0, no samples will be excluded from subsequent analyses.
