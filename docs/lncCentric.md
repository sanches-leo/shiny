In some cases, an **lncRNA may not cluster into any module** or may be **excluded by standard module selection criteria** during network construction. To ensure that potentially relevant lncRNAs are not overlooked, **LACEN** offers an alternative approach for evaluating their connectivity and functional context outside of module assignments.

This function allows users to explore the **local co-expression environment** of a specific lncRNA by leveraging the **topological overlap matrix (TOM)**. Given an lncRNA identifier and a **LACEN object** containing the constructed co-expression network, the following steps are performed:

- **Identification of Correlated Genes**: Retrieves the most highly co-expressed genes with the selected lncRNA based on TOM similarity, which considers both direct and shared network connections.
- **Subnetwork Visualization**: Constructs a focused subnetwork graph showing the strongest co-expression relationships between the lncRNA and its top connected protein-coding genes.
- **Functional Enrichment Analysis**: Performs over-representation analysis of the retrieved gene set to identify enriched biological processes or pathways.
- **Enrichment Visualization**: Displays the top enrichment results in an interpretable format, supporting **guilt-by-association** inference of the lncRNAâ€™s potential biological roles.

## User-Configurable Parameters

- **Gene Count for Enrichment**  
  Specifies the number of top-connected genes (ranked by TOM similarity to the lncRNA) used in the enrichment analysis.  
  - A smaller value targets the most tightly co-expressed genes, enhancing specificity.  
  - A larger value broadens the analysis scope, potentially capturing more functional diversity.

- **Gene Count for Visualization**  
  Sets the number of genes to display in the subnetwork graph. Reducing the number can simplify visualization, especially in densely connected networks.


- **Pathway Count for Plotting**  
  Defines how many of the most significantly enriched biological terms or pathways will be annotated in the subnetwork plot. This helps balance interpretability and information density.

- **Enrichment Sources**  
  Choose from the following biological databases for functional annotation:  
  - **Gene Ontology (GO)**: Includes *Biological Processes (BP)*, *Molecular Functions (MF)*, and *Cellular Components (CC)*.  
  - **Pathways**: Includes curated data from **KEGG** and **Reactome**.
