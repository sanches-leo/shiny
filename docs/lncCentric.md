# lncRNA-Centric Analysis

For cases where an lncRNA does not cluster into any module or is filtered out by the standard module selection criteria, LACEN provides an alternative approach to analyze its connectivity. This function identifies the most connected genes associated with a specific lncRNA, generates a subnetwork visualization, and performs functional enrichment analysis.

Using a given lncRNA identifier and a LACEN object containing the coexpression network data, this analysis:

- Identifies the most highly correlated genes with the selected lncRNA using the topological overlap matrix (TOM).
- Performs functional enrichment analysis of this gene set, identifying enriched terms from:
    - Gene Ontology (GO): Biological Processes, Molecular Functions, Cellular Components.
    - Pathways: KEGG and Reactome.
- Generates a network plot showing the strongest coexpression relationships.
- Visualizes the enrichment results, helping to infer potential functions of the lncRNA.
