# Soft Threshold

Selecting an appropriate soft-threshold power ensures a scale-free topology for your network. Inspect the resulting plot and choose the power value maximizing the model fit. It's advised to select the minimum threshold where the curve stabilize close to 0.9 and still has a connectivity > 50.
