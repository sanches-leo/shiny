Selecting an appropriate soft-thresholding power is a critical step to ensure that the resulting network approximates a scale-free topology, a common feature of biological networks. This is typically done by evaluating the scale-free topology fit index (R²) across a range of power values. In the diagnostic plot, look for the lowest power at which the R² curve reaches a plateau near or above 0.9, indicating a good fit to the scale-free model. At the same time, make sure the mean connectivity remains reasonably high (typically above 50) to preserve sufficient network complexity and avoid overly sparse networks. Balancing these two criteria—high scale-free topology fit and acceptable connectivity—helps ensure robust and biologically meaningful module detection.
