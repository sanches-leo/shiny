# Heatmap 

This step generates a heatmap for a selected module or module/submodule, visualizing the interconnectedness of genes based on the topological overlap matrix (TOM). The heatmap highlights the coexpression relationships between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes, helping to identify highly connected lncRNAs within the network.

By analyzing these highly connected lncRNAs, users can investigate their co-expressed protein-coding genes and infer potential functional roles using a guilt-by-association approach. Just input one module and submodule (optional) to analyze.
