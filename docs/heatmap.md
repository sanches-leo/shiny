This step generates a heatmap for a selected module or module/submodule pair, providing a visual representation of gene interconnectedness based on the topological overlap matrix (TOM). The TOM quantifies the similarity of co-expression patterns between genes, emphasizing stronger interactions within tightly connected modules. The resulting heatmap highlights the co-expression relationships between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and protein-coding genes (PCGs), allowing users to visually identify hub lncRNAsâ€”those that are highly connected within the network and likely to play key regulatory roles.

To generate the heatmap, users must specify a module and optionally a submodule. Additionally, users can customize the dimensions of the heatmap by selecting the number of lncRNAs and PCGs to include, providing flexibility in visualization according to the desired resolution or focus.
