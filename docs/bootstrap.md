# Bootstrap

The bootstrap stability analysis assess the robustness of the gene network using the bootstrap method. This approach repeatedly builds networks 100 times, omitting subsets of genes to identify consistently stable modules. Reviewing the provided stability plots, a specify a stability cutoff to retain robust genes
