The bootstrap stability analysis evaluates the robustness of the gene co-expression network by applying a resampling-based approach. Since `LACEN` is designed to identify functionally relevant hub lncRNAs, it is crucial to eliminate highly unstable or noisy genes that could compromise network reliability. To achieve this, the analysis constructs the network 100 times, each time omitting random subsets of genes. This repeated sampling allows the identification of modules and gene connections that remain stable across multiple iterations. The resulting stability scores reflect how consistently each gene is assigned to the same module. Users can inspect the generated stability plots to determine an appropriate stability cutoff, retaining only genes with robust module membership while filtering out the most unstable (variable) ones.
