This step prepares the data for network construction by filtering out low-variation genes. Users can choose between two filtering criteria: differentially expressed genes `DEG` or the median absolute deviation `var`.  Both methods remove genes with low counts and no expression. DEG-based filtering applies a variance threshold based on the variability of genes identified by the user as differentially expressed. In contrast, MAD-based filtering selects the top n most variable genes according to their median absolute deviation. Variance-based `var` filtering is recommended when memory resources are limited, as it more aggressively reduces the dataset size.
